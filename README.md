# TrownIT

TROWN'IT was built to take advantage of blockchain technology by leveraging and unlocking the extra power of NFT utilities, by living or visiting anywhere in the real world at your own convinience.

## Inspiration

The role of real estate in any developed or developing economy can hardly be understated. In one way or another, it impinges upon virtually every domestic and commercial activity at all levels of society. The real estate market is formed by the interaction of buyers and sellers in exchanging real property rights for other
assets, usually money. However with the adoption of blockchain technology, real estate properties are represented in the form of NFT's, and their implementations are not yet well explored in relation with the real world.

Our inspiration for TROWN'IT came from our interest in real estate properties in the real world and NFT's in the virtual/decentralized world. With few years of experience in property management as real estate agents, we have always wanted to explore real estates properties(NFT's) that will represent real world locations where ever we visited or wanted to live either through renting or owning. Thus, we set out to build a
real estate marketplace where anyone could get the opportunity/offers to buy or rent a property in the form of an NFT at any location they find themselves.

## What it does

Trown’IT is a platform that makes this possible, it allows users to Mint Asset-backed NFTs (i.e NFTs
representing physical assets), Rent and Trade this tokenized assets on the Blockchain. 

Instead of referencing a digital piece of art, a NFT can point to the barcode, or an identifier of a physical asset. This process is known as Tokenization and it involves taking assets outside a blockchain and bringing them into it.

## How I built it

Trown’IT Architecture is seperated into three categories:

1.) Smart Contract
2.) Assets 
3.) Images



## Challenges I ran into

It was tough orgnising the UI/UX design together with linking of the smart contract with the frontend for we hope to build a nice MVP but couldn't due to few man power.
